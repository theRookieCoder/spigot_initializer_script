# Spigot initializer script
## A script to initialize (create) a new Spigot plugin project
TODO (Also caveats I guess?):
- [ ] Implement a way to select different versions
- [ ] Implement a way to use '~' instead on /Users/name etc
- [ ] A GUI similar to macOS application installers or Windows .msi things
